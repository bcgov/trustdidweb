# Trust DID Web Has Moved to the Decentralized Identity Foundation

The Trust DID Web (`did:tdw`) DID Method specification has moved to: [https://identity.foundation/trustdidweb](https://identity.foundation/trustdidweb)

The repository for the specification has moved to [https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trustdidweb](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trustdidweb)

Thanks to the **Government of British Columbia** for incubating the specification and initial implementations.

Thanks to the [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/) for providing a home for the next step in creating `did:tdw`.
